            <h1>Deranged Designs</h1>
            <h2>Deranged Designs is a horror-puzzle game where players return to their old childhood home and stumble upon a disturbing mystery hidden within a collection of old video games. As the player explores the house and plays these strange games, they uncover dark secrets and twisted memories, all while being pulled into increasingly unsettling and surreal experiences. The game is both a tribute to 50 years of gaming history and a psychological horror story, blending nostalgic references with disturbing elements.</h2>

            <h2>Cybernetic Clash is a high-octane, action-packed platformer where speed and precision are crucial. The player's character is a cybernetically enhanced warrior whose health bar is continuously depleting throughout each level. The goal is to reach the end of each level as fast as possible, navigating obstacles and defeating enemies before the health bar runs out completely. Every second counts, forcing players to maintain relentless momentum and perfect their platforming skills.</h2>
